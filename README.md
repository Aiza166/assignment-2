# Blog Summariser

This is a full-stack web application that takes a blog URL as input, scrapes the main article content, generates a concise summary in English, and provides a basic Urdu translation using a static dictionary.

Built as Assignment 2 for Nexium's internship program.

## Features

- Input a public blog URL.
- Scrape and clean the blog content using JSDOM and Mozilla's Readability.
- Simulate AI-generated summary using simple sentence slicing.
- Translate summary into Urdu using a manually built static dictionary.
- Save summaries to **Supabase** (PostgreSQL).
- Save full blog content to **MongoDB Atlas**.
- Built with **Next.js 15 App Router**, **ShadCN UI**, and deployed to **Vercel**.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- ShadCN UI + DaisyUI
- Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- MongoDB Atlas
- Axios, JSDOM, Readability
- Vercel (for deployment)

## How It Works

1. The user inputs a blog URL on the frontend.
2. The server fetches the HTML using a proxy (thingproxy) to avoid CORS issues.
3. The article content is extracted using Mozilla’s Readability.
4. A basic summary is generated by slicing the first few sentences.
5. Each English word is matched against a static Urdu dictionary; unmatched words are wrapped in [brackets].
6. Both summaries are saved:
- English + Urdu → Supabase
- Full blog text → MongoDB

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/assignment-2.git
cd assignment-2
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```
3. Create `.env.local`
Configure your Supabase and MongoDB credentials:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
```
4. Run the dev server
```bash
pnpm dev
```
5. Deploy to Vercel
- Push code to GitHub.
- Connect the repo to `vercel.com`.
- Set environment variables on Vercel dashboard.

## Notes
- Urdu translation is static and only works for predefined words in the dictionary.
- Unmatched words are shown in square brackets for clarity.
- Uses Readability for more accurate blog text extraction.
- No authentication or rate limiting included.
